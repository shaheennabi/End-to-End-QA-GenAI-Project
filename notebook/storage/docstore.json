The\ndeep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images),\nand it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different\ncategories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention\nrequired and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning\nas \"scalable machine learning\" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (link resides\noutside ibm.com).\nClassical, or \"non-deep,\" machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to\nlearn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences\nbetween data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.\nNeural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers,\ncontaining an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or\nartificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the\noutput of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is\nactivated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed\nalong to the next layer of the network by that node. The \u201cdeep\u201d in deep learning is just\nreferring to the number of layers in a neural network.

Based on some input data, which can be labeled or\nunlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.\nAn Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If\nthere are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess\nthe accuracy of the model.\nA Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the\ntraining set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the\nknown example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative\n\u201cevaluate and optimize\u201d process, updating weights autonomously until a\nthreshold of accuracy has been met.\nMachine learning methods\nMachine learning models fall into three primary categories.\nSupervised machine learning\nSupervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use\nof labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.\nAs input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted\nappropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the\nmodel avoids overfitting or underfitting.

Some of these include:\nTechnological singularity\nWhile this topic garners a lot of public attention, many researchers are not concerned\nwith the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence in the near future. Technological\nsingularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick\nBostrum defines superintelligence as \u201cany intellect that vastly outperforms the best\nhuman brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom,\nand social skills.\u201d Despite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the\nidea of it raises some interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous\nsystems, like self-driving cars. It\u2019s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never\nhave an accident, but who is responsible and liable under those circumstances? Should\nwe still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to\nsemi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this,\nbut these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI\ntechnology develops.\nAI impact on jobs\nWhile a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this\nconcern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see\nthat the market demand for specific job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the\nautomotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric\nvehicle production to align with green initiatives.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 13631, "end_char_idx": 16019, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e255257-0b23-499f-8f97-b6e9ed840dac": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e255257-0b23-499f-8f97-b6e9ed840dac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\mailm\\Downloads\\projects\\End-to-End-QA-GenAI-Project\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21968, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f93e2cca-539a-461a-af89-28099a361dbb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\mailm\\Downloads\\projects\\End-to-End-QA-GenAI-Project\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21968, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "19efef6b5bfdca5bc09c28f0ca0a78361f15a7d1237b4a54bba7e4b48a7d900d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0f12afb-345c-426c-ace7-e468897cdb32", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\mailm\\Downloads\\projects\\End-to-End-QA-GenAI-Project\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21968, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "5db391b05550e0e9a6336db15e67a99a2ab07e5062bcc9fe3fb73e22cbaeee09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4140075-6f64-40db-b1b9-98d56c9d43c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2713c559b024ba767f1af028b58107dc55c1be23794e05c38da7fd5ba85b36e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The energy industry isn\u2019t going away,\nbut the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.\nIn a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There\nwill need to be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people\nto address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be\naffected by job demand shifts, such as customer service. The biggest challenge with\nartificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition\nto new roles that are in demand.\nPrivacy\nPrivacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data\nsecurity. These concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent\nyears. For example, in 2016, GDPR legislation was created to protect the personal data\nof people in the European Union and European Economic Area, giving individuals more\ncontrol of their data. In the United States, individual states are developing policies, such\nas the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was introduced in 2018 and\nrequires businesses to inform consumers about the collection of their data. Legislation\nsuch as this has forced companies to rethink how they store and use personally\nidentifiable information (PII). As a result, investments in security have become an\nincreasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any vulnerabilities and\nopportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks.\nBias and discrimination\nInstances of bias and discrimination across a number of machine learning systems have\nraised many ethical questions regarding the use of artificial intelligence. How can we\nsafeguard against bias and discrimination when the training data itself may be\ngenerated by biased human processes? While companies typically have good\nintentions for their automation efforts, Reuters (link resides outside ibm.com) highlights\nsome of the unforeseen consequences of incorporating AI into hiring practices.
