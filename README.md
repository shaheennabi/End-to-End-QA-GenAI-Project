# 🎆 **End-to-End QA GenAI Project** 🎆

Welcome to the **End-to-End QA GenAI Project**, where **cutting-edge technology** meets **seamless user experience**! 🚀 This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system with a **Streamlit UI** for uploading and processing **PDF documents**. It leverages the **Google Gemini API** (featuring the powerful **Gemini Pro model**) for high-performance **natural language understanding** and **generation**. The **LlamaIndex** framework is used for **efficient document indexing** and **retrieval**, enabling fast and accurate query responses. 🔍💬

With this system, you can interact with documents in a whole new way: **upload**, **query**, and **generate** intelligent responses! 🎉

## 🏗️ **Architecture** 🏗️

The system is built with a **modular** design for scalability and easy maintenance. Below are the core components that make everything work:

1. **Streamlit UI**: Upload PDF files and interact with the system seamlessly.  
2. **Document Preprocessing**: Extracts content from PDFs for indexing and retrieval.  
3. **LlamaIndex Integration**: Indexes document content for **fast search** and retrieval.  
4. **Google Gemini API**: Processes queries and generates responses using the **Gemini Pro model**.  
5. **Modular Code**: Cleanly separated components for easy updates and improvements.

## ⚙️ **Setup** ⚙️

Get ready to set up your local environment and dive into this **powerful GenAI system**! Follow the steps below to get started:

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.9 or higher.  
- **Google Gemini API** credentials.  
- **LlamaIndex** library.  

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaheennabi/End-to-End-QA-GenAI-Project.git
   cd End-to-End-QA-GenAI-Project
   ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3.9 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your **Google Gemini API** credentials. Follow [Google's official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) for setting up the API credentials.

5. Install **LlamaIndex**:

   ```bash
   pip install llama-index
   ```

## 🚀 **Running the Application** 🚀

Now that you're all set up, let’s get the app running:

1. Start the **Streamlit app**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) to interact with the app. 🎉

3. **Upload a PDF file** and query it for intelligent responses generated using **Gemini Pro**!

---

## 🔄 **Workflow** 🔄

Here’s how the magic happens:

1. **Upload PDF**: The user uploads a PDF file through the **Streamlit UI**.  
2. **Text Extraction**: The system extracts text content from the uploaded PDF.  
3. **Document Indexing**: The text is indexed using **LlamaIndex** for **quick retrieval**.  
4. **Query Generation**: The user submits a query, which is processed by the **Gemini Pro model**.  
5. **Response Generation**: The system retrieves the relevant information and generates a **natural language response** using the **Gemini API**. 🎯

## 🔌 **API Integration** 🔌

This project utilizes the **Google Gemini API** (with the **Gemini Pro model**) for natural language generation. To interact with the API, you must set up your **Google Gemini API credentials** in the `config.py` file.

---

## 🌱 **Future Enhancements** 🌱

- 🌍 **Multilingual Support**: Extend the system to support **multiple languages** for text generation.  
- 📝 **Document Summarization**: Automatically generate summaries for **long documents**.  
- 🔎 **Advanced Search Features**: Add advanced search and filtering capabilities for document retrieval.
